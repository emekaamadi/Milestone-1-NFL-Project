# NFL Quarterback Versatility Analysis &#127944;

In the realm of sports, analytics have emerged as a crucial element of decision-making over the past decade. Both teams and sports analytics companies have actively pursued insights derived from data for various purposes including player improvement, roster optimization, and player evaluation.

By leveraging player-tracking data and play-by-play data, our project aims to shed light on the effectiveness of quarterbacks when throwing from different positions, angles, and distances as well as their overall performance in various areas of the field. Through this analysis, we seek to identify which QBs exhibit the most versatility.

Our main question we want to answer is, “Which NFL quarterbacks are the most adept at completing passes from different angles and directions?” Our goal is to bring quantitative measures of versatility into the discourse. Future refined studies on this topic could be leveraged in player evaluation frameworks at both the amateur and professional levels to improve roster decision-making.
